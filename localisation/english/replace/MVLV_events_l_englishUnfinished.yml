However, these self-policing groups turn into hotbeds of terrorism and gradually launch attacks on receiving countries that do not protect them. At first, the attacks were sporadic and did not cause much damage, but according to recent reports, the "Refugee Liberation Front", an organization organized by the Christians of the Compassionate Sect, has brought together the vigilante groups of the refugee camps and begun to carry out attacks in an organized manner. This is on a scale that cannot be stopped by police organizations alone, and its impact is deepening. "

The Refugee Liberation Front is demanding better lives for refugees and the right to vote, and those who had refused to participate in terrorist activities have been inspired by the participants around them to join the Refugee Liberation Front. So far, relying on reserves, strikes on frontline supplies have been more or less subdued, but it is only a matter of time before this attack has an impact on the ability to execute the war. The Ministry of Defense has asked the government not to compromise on terrorism, but other factions within the government believe that the situation can be calmed by meeting the demands of the refugees.

According to reports from the secret police, the production of weapons for the mass uprising seems to have begun in the occupied factories.

Have the officer members do ideological work with their subordinates, and the more people who fall to us, the better. If the Fuji Instruction Corps is willing to join that would be best.
