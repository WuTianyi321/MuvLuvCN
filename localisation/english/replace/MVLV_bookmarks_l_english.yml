 1973_START_NAME:0 "BETA Invasion"
 1973_START_DESC:0 "There's a wild BETA out there! \n You can't play it yet (it may be implemented as a completely different scenario in the future)"
 1999_START_NAME:0 "Operation Lucifer"
 1999_START_DESC:0 "It is 1999 and humanity stands on the brink of extinction. After nearly 30 years of fighting the BETA, humanity has almost lost all of Eurasia. The BETA's eastward advance, which began nine years ago, has now reached the Japanese archipelago. If the BETA is not stopped there, humanity's annihilation will be inevitable."
 JAP_1999_START_DESC:0 "Japan lost a lot of territory and people in the BETA invasion that began in 1998. The resistance of the Teito Absolute Defense Line bought several months of evacuation time, but now the BETA have reached the Kanto region. To make matters worse, the BETA that reached Sado Island have started to build a hive. Together with the U.S. and UN forces in Japan, they have managed to hold their ground, but the day when the new imperial capital of Tokyo will fall may be near."
 BET_1999_START_DESC:0 "BETA is an extraterrestrial species hostile to humanity that has been invading the Earth since 1973. 90% of the Eurasian continent has already been conquered as of 1999, and at this rate, it is expected to be fully conquered in a few more years."
 USA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The United States of America is the only superpower that has not been invaded by BETA, and in 1999 it is the strongest nation in the world in both name and reality. However, due to the fact that it exports weapons and lends factories to countries around the world, and due to the lack of interest in war among its citizens, it is difficult to say that it has enough munitions factories to maintain its own military. However, their total industrial strength is overwhelming, and if they demonstrate their true power, they may be able to open the way to victory for mankind."
 EUR_1999_START_DESC:0 "As of 1999, the continent of Europe has been completely overrun by BETA, with only the island nation of Britain and the Italian island of Sicily remaining. "
 SOV_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Soviet Union was once a superpower that rivaled the United States, but as of 1999, it has lost most of its land to BETA. However, because it moved its military and industrial forces backward as quickly as possible, the Soviet Union still retains the military and industrial strength to be a superpower even after losing its land. The leadership of the Communist Party, which resides in Alaska, a state leased from the U.S., is watching vigilantly for the time when it can reclaim its land and overthrow the U.S."
 UNI_1999_START_DESC:0 "When the BETA War broke out, the countries of the West and the East did not coordinate at all and conducted reckless operations, which resulted in many casualties. As of 1999, the United Nations Joint Force was formed by absorbing the armies of the Eurasian countries that had lost their lands, and conducting battles in each country. They also have a huge fleet established with ships provided by other countries. The human race has yet to build a cooperative relationship in the face of a common enemy, but if the United Nations shows its power, the attitude of the nations may change."
 AFR_1999_START_DESC:0 "Africa, the birthplace of mankind, has reached a major turning point after Europe was turned into a battlefield by the BETA war. Many European countries that lost their land began to invest heavily in their former colonies in Africa. They built many factories in Africa and invested heavily in infrastructure, and as a result, African countries became major powers with some of the largest cities in the world. On the military front, African countries have formed a coalition and are concentrating their forces on the Suez absolute defense line for defense. Now is the time for Africans to defeat the BETA and put an end to the past. "
 CHI_1999_START_DESC:0 "When BETA first invaded Earth, the People's Republic of China attempted to single-handedly repel it and monopolize the unknown technology. However, it was hit hard by the emergence of the ray class, and the Communist government was forced to leave the continent without satisfactorily rebuilding its military. Therefore, the Communist government conducted the Third Nationalist-Communist Alliance with the Taiwanese government of the Republic of China, another China, and shocked the world. However, there is no way that the two countries, which have different political systems and everything, will be able to get along, and various problems have been occurring frequently. At this rate, Taiwan will not be able to defend itself. "
 GEU_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Greater East Asia Coalition was a coalition of nations formed by China, India, Korea, Indonesia, and other Far Eastern nations, excluding Japan. Initially, each of these nations was incorporated into the UN forces and continued to fight against BETA, but with the loss of their land, high morale, and no strong backing, they were sent to the front lines where they were at a disadvantage. As of 1999, they are fighting a defensive battle in the Malay Peninsula, but since most of the Japanese and UN forces have moved to the Japanese mainland, the Greater East Asia Coalition alone must carry out the defensive battle. However, since most of the Japanese and UN forces have moved to the Japanese mainland, the Greater East Asia Coalition alone must carry out the defense."
 SOA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Confederate States of America is a coalition of nations formed by the nations of the South American continent to wage war against BETA, but its armaments are greatly limited by a treaty with the United States of America, which was signed in the context of the Americas, the most backward nation in the human race."
 CEA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Central American Coalition is a coalition of nations formed by the nations of the South American continent to wage war against BETA, but its armaments are severely limited by a treaty with the United States of America, which was signed in the context of the Americas, the most backward nation in the human race."
 OSE_1999_START_DESC:0 "Australia is one of the nations that has been largely unaffected by the devastating effects of the BETA war. The continent is blessed with a healthy natural environment that is now priceless, and is a major producer of natural food with a food self-sufficiency rate of over 300%. This is due to the labor force that has been obtained by actively accepting refugees, but an increase in the number of refugees could have a negative impact on the nation. Even more problematic than the refugees is the BETA looming over Southeast Asia. Australia will be on the front line if the Greater East Asia Coalition falls, so the pressure is on to expand its military."
 CAN_1999_START_DESC:0 "Canada was hit hard by the intensive nuclear attacks on BETA landing units in the early stages of the BETA war. The northeastern part of Canada was turned into an uninhabitable land by radiation. Although the country has received a great deal of support from the United States, it is still far from recovery even 30 years after the nuclear attack, and it will take a long time to rebuild the country."
 EEA_1999_START_DESC:0 "The Socialist Alliance of Eastern Europe is a national coalition of former Eastern European countries, centered on East Germany. However, since it was invaded by BETA before the Western European countries, its existing national power is extremely limited, and its status is only to provide military power as an observer country of the European Union. It used to operate everything from equipment to tactics in the Soviet style, but with the Soviet Union's withdrawal to the Far East and the loss of its influence in Europe, as well as the military exchanges between East and West Germany, it has been closing the distance between itself and Western Europe."
 OTHER_1999_START_DESC:0 "Why are you playing a minor in Muv Luv lmao"
